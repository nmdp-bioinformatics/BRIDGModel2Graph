The date range is an interval (IVL) data type meaning it has a beginning (low) and end (high) values. It is also a datetime (TS.DATETIME) data type meaning the beginning date and the end date can have uncertain values (e.g. a range). For example if a subject was diagnosed with leukemia sometime in 2009 and that subject had a transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010. We can surmise that the subject must have had a preparative regimen sometime between those times. Therefore the preparative regimen activity would have a beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and an ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31.
