Phase 1: The initial introduction of an investigational new drug into humans. Phase 1 studies are typically closely monitored and may be conducted in patients or normal volunteer subjects. Phase 2: Controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 3: Studies are expanded controlled and uncontrolled. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the drug has been obtained and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3b: Phase 3b studies are a sub category of phase 3 near the time of approval to elicit additional findings. Phase 4: Concurrent with marketing approval Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may seek agreement from the sponsor to conduct certain post-marketing (phase 4) studies to delineate additional information about the drug's risks benefits and optimal use.

For example if a subject was diagnosed with leukemia sometime in 2009 and that subject had a transplant (substance administration) sometime in 2010. We can surmise that the subject must have had a preparative regimen sometime between those times. Therefore the preparative regimen activity would have a beginning (low) date range of between 2009-01-01 and 2009-12-31; and an ending (high) date range of between 2010-01-01 and 2010-12-31.

This is the focus of an observation. EXAMPLE(S): Biomarkers include but are not limited to such phenotypic parameters as specific enzyme or hormone concentration specific gene phenotype presence or absence of biological substance. For an observation with a nameCode of Determine the Allele for the HLA-A Locus on Chromosome 6 the observation result might have a targetBiomarkerCode of HLA-A and a value of HLA-A*01:01:01 (the specific allele) For an observation with a nameCode of Determine the variant nucleotide for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism RS110789 the observation result might have a targetBiomarkerCode of Rs110789 and a value of C (cytosine the specific nucleotide that is variant) OTHER NAME(S): Genetic Marker NOTE(S): There is no associated 'approach' for a Biomarker as there is for an anatomic site. In the context of Bone Marrow Transplantation the bodily substance that is collected to determine the Biomarker (the HLA Alleles) is typically blood or saliva. Thus the thing that is collected is the typeCode of the Material that is collected via a PerformedSpecimenCollection. The attribute 'targetBiomarkerCode' was chosen as inclusive of 'targetGeneticMarkerCode' which is more specific to the Bone Marrow Transplantation domain.
