A StudyProtocolDocumentVersion is related to other supporting document versions involved in the study including (but not limited to) informed consent documents case report forms (CRFs) regulatory and approval documentation correlative studies etc. via the inherited association to DocumentVersionRelationship.

Submissions are always associated with some regulatory action (or inaction). Each submission contains their own regulatory action. Submissions (e.g. initial marketing application supplemental marketing application) would generally be comprised of multiple submissions units. Most typically the submission will be used to organize information based on a review clock. Receipt date from the regulatory authority is important for a submission. "
SubmissionUnit,Regulatory Sub-Domain,3.0.3,"DEFINITION: The collection of documents provided to the regulatory authority at one time.
